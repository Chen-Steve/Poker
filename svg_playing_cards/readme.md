How to Play
- Hit: Draw another card from the deck.
- Stand: Stop drawing cards and end your turn.
- Deal: Start a new round.
- The game follows standard Blackjack rules:

1. Aim to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth 10. Aces can be worth 1 or 11.
If you exceed 21, you 'bust' and automatically lose the round.
